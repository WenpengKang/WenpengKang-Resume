        Librarian<br>It is often said that only by reading poems and books can we know the whole world. The ancients also often taught us that we should read more than ten thousand books, and that there are more than ten thousand books in the library. The job of a librarian is to organize, code and put on shelves ten thousand volumes of poetry books for the convenience of readers. Although the job is trivial, don't feel discouraged because what you are burdened with is a little administrator. You can read more books close to the water!<br>

        Business management<br>The specific identity of middle managers is relatively complex: in terms of personnel relations, middle managers are the executor of orders in front of superiors and the representative of corporate image in front of subordinates. They are entrusted by superiors to manage a certain department and cooperate with other department managers to complete tasks assigned by superiors. In the aspect of enterprise decision-making, middle managers are the provider and supporter of intelligence, the communicator and builder of enterprise culture, which is the most fundamental positioning of middle managers<br>
